!!!!!!!!!!!!!!#Potential issues 
 1. In the code, in order to find out the resolution of the Registers im looking 
 at  Registers_THS.BitInfo[0].bit property - THE first one - so if you wanna add 
 the option to edit those Registers In real time you might put the first column to
 last because if pure code bs, so be careful what objects you will be creating.
